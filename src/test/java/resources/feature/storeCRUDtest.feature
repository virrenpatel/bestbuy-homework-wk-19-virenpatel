  As a user I want to test store application

  Scenario Outline: CRUD Test

    When I create store with name "<name>" type"<type>" address"<address>" address2"<address2>" city"<city>" state"<state>" zip"<zip>" lat"<lat>" lng"<lng>" hours"<hours>"
    And I verify store created
    And I update store with name "<name>" type"<type>" address"<address>" address2"<address2>" city"<city>" state"<state>" zip"<zip>" lat"<lat>" lng"<lng>" hours"<hours>"
    And I check store is updated successfully
    And I delete store
    Then I verify that store is deleted successfully
